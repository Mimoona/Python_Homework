Create a program to manage a list of phone-numbers.
These numbers should be valid and stored in a dictionary

Task 1: Ask the user to input:
1. Name
2. Phone prefix
3. Phone number


Task 2: Check if the input prefix and number are valid, by using the functions above
Hint: don't forget to call the functions


Task 3: Add the COMPLETE number in phone_numbers and print phone_numbers
The complete number should include the prefix, an empty space after it and the number
Example: +49 9863456

Task 4: Store the current value of phone_numbers into a file called numbers.txt
Hints:
   1. don't forget to open the file using the rigth mode
   2. To write phone_numbers as a string, you can use str(phone_numbers) and write the string in the file


Task 5: Change the program to run untill the input name is "STOP"
The content of the file should be written after this

Task 6: Change you code, and instead of asking the user to input the phone prefix difrectly, ask for the country
	Check if the country is available in possible_countries
	If it is, use the phone prefix provided (you can remove the step to validate prefix)
	If it is not, print an error message and start from the begining

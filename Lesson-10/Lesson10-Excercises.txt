Exercise 1:
~~~~~~~~~~
1. Create a list of 4 users: Ahmed, Yong, Sudhir, Julie
2. Ask a user to enter her/his name
3. Check if the name exists in the users list
4. if the name exists, print a welcome message
5. if the name does not exists, print a sorry message

Exercise 2:
~~~~~~~~~~
Extend the code in Exercise 1 to handle the below case:

If the input name is not in the users list, print a sorry message and ask the user to try again. 
You should keep asking the user to retry until s/he enters a name that belongs to the list :)

Hint: use while

Exercise 3:
~~~~~~~~~~~
Extend the code in Exercise 2 to handle the below case:

Now for each user, add a given password:
e.g. 'Ahmed': 's1234' # use a data structure that you have seen in previous lessons ;)

Now if the input name is correct, ask for the password.
If the password is correct, print a welcome message
Otherwise print a sorry message explaining that the password was wrong.

Exercise 4:
~~~~~~~~~~~
Extend the code in Exercise 3 to handle the below case:

If the user enters a wrong password, give her/him another chances.
If after 3 times the password is wrong add the user name into a new list called "blocked_users" and tell the user that her/his account is now blocked.

If the same user tries to log again, print a message that his account have been temporarily locked.

Exercise 5 (Optional – Bonus exercise):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Extend the code in Exercise 4 to handle the below case:

If user enters a name that does not exists in the user lists, print a sorry message and ask if s/he would like to register. 
If user enters 'y', 
- save her/his name
- ask user to enter a password
(Optional: ask the user to enter it twice and only accept if first and second matches)

If user enter different character than 'y', program should start the flow and ask user to enter username
